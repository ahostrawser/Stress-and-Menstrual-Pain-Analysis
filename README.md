# Stress-and-Menstrual-Pain-Analysis

## Context and Background
Most women experience menstrual cycles for a significant period of their lives. Throughout the cycle, fluctuating hormones and symptoms (like pain, fatigue, and mood changes) can significantly impact their lives and productivity. Understanding the relationship between stress and menstrual pain is essential because it can help women understand and identify techniques to reduce menstrual pain and its impact on their lives.

## Project Scope
The scope of this project will entail an analysis of the 2025 Menstrual Health & Productivity dataset from Kaggle with a focus on the stress score and pain level score variables. This process will include gathering and wrangling the data, performing exploratory data analysis, drawing conclusions, and communicating the results.
